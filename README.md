###Pokedex

I saw a pokemon API online and wanted to display its contents!
A simple little react web app that displays the original 150 and lets you see some information about them.

Uses React for UI, Redux for state, Redux-Thunk as middleware, and axios for http requests.  

If you are interested in any of these technologies, following along as I develop (or looking at my project/git history) could be a fun way to learn a thing or two.

Currently in progress.

To run, clone the repo, run 
npm install
then
npm start

Open the page at localhost:3000. enjoy!
